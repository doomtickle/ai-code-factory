- **Security hardening (review findings 5, 7-9).** Judgement calls:
  - **`web_fetch`'s hard-coded credentialed-host denylist**: `github.com`,
    `api.github.com`, `*.githubusercontent.com` (git tooling); `api.atlassian.com`,
    `*.atlassian.net` (Jira); `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` (Gemini);
    and whatever host `[packages].npm_private_registry` resolves to, read
    fresh from policy on every call since that setting is a deployment
    overlay. This list is hosts the egress proxy or another broker tool
    attaches a credential to - not every host those tools happen to talk
    to - because the risk is specifically an unauthenticated-looking
    `web_fetch` call turning into an authenticated read that bypasses that
    tool's own allowlist (e.g. `[git].repos`). It is checked before
    `[web].allow_hosts` and cannot be overridden by editing that list; the
    denial message names the dedicated tool to use instead.
  - **"Tools that write externally" (finding 7) is the hard-coded set
    `{git_push, github_create_pr}`** in `passdesk/core/protocol.py`, not a
    new field on every registered tool. Only these two have an effect
    outside the broker's own state; a future such tool must be added to
    that set by hand. The pre-run "intent" audit record is best-effort
    logging of what is about to happen, not a tamper-evident log (that
    remains out of scope / roadmap) - it just means the attempt is on
    record a step earlier than before, and the call is refused outright if
    even that first write fails.
  - **Content-Length handling (finding 8) treats missing, non-numeric and
    negative values alike as 400,** before the existing 1 MB
    (`MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`) cap is applied. None of the three is a "request
    too large"; conflating them with it previously let a header-less or
    malformed request silently read 0 bytes instead of being rejected.
  - **Finding 9's wrapping is limited to bodies that genuinely come from a
    remote service or `git push`'s own stderr/stdout** (GitHub's PR-create
    error, Jira's and Gemini's HTTP error bodies, and the push rejection
    text GitHub forwards through `git push`): local git/bundle errors
    (`git.py`'s `git()`/`git_capped()` helpers, bundle `verify` failures)
    stay sanitize-only, since that text is the broker's own git client
    talking about local state, not content from the internet.

- **Security hardening (review findings 1-4 and 6).** Judgement calls:
  - **`pip_download` now requires `--hash=sha256:` on every line.** This is
    a breaking change for callers whose requirements files are pinned but
    unhashed; they get a DENIED naming `--generate-hashes`. Without hashes
    pip would accept whatever PyPI serves for the pin. Only sha256 is
    accepted (what pip-compile and uv emit). Environment markers are kept
    but restricted to a charset with no `-`, so nothing in one can read as a
    pip option; extras are dropped from the file pip sees, since
    `--no-deps` makes them meaningless.
  - **`git_push` bundle cap: `[filters].max_bundle_bytes` = 100 MB.** Large
    enough for a whole-branch bundle of a mid-sized repo (the tool
    description still allows "the whole branch"), small enough that a
    copy into broker-private space is cheap. Deployments with big repos can
    raise it in their overlay.
  - **`max_diff_bytes` now counts every pushed commit's patch**, binary
    files included, not the net diff. A branch that rewrites the same file
    many times can hit it sooner than before; the per-commit scan is what
    closes the add-then-delete hole, and the cap keeps the broker from
    reading an unbounded `git log -p` into memory (the output is streamed
    and the process killed at the cap). Commit messages are capped at the
    same size.
  - **Merges are scanned with `--cc`**, which shows only what a merge
    changes beyond its parents; content from a parent is scanned in that
    parent's own commit or is already upstream.
  - **Symlinks are refused everywhere under the workspace, even ones that
    point inside it.** Simpler to reason about than resolving and
    re-checking, and race-free: directories are opened component by
    component with `O_NOFOLLOW` from the workspace root. A caller with a
    symlinked `requirements.txt` or lockfile directory must use the real
    path.
  - **Broker-private temp space is `$BROKER_STATE/tmp/`** (mode 0700, one
    directory per call, removed afterwards), not the system temp dir, so
    large wheels and bundles land on the state volume.
  - **Not fixed (out of scope):** secrets in UTF-16 text or inside
    compressed files (zip, gzip) are not visible to the pattern scan.

- **Extraction.** Pulled out of `ai-code-factory` with history preserved, via
  a subtree split of its former `broker/` directory rather than a plain copy.
- **Consumption.** `ai-code-factory` consumes this repository as a git
  submodule at `broker/`, pinned by commit — not by an image digest, because
  there is no registry yet to push a built image to. See that repo's
  `docs/broker-extraction.md` (Phase 2) for the plan to move to a
  digest-pinned image once one exists.
- **Submodule URL.** `ai-code-factory`'s `.gitmodules` points at the relative
  URL `../passdesk-broker.git`, so it resolves next to whatever host
  `ai-code-factory`'s own `origin` is on (GitHub, in this case). **Not done
  yet:** the user needs to create the `passdesk-broker` repository on GitHub
  and push both repositories there before the submodule link is live for
  anyone other than this sandbox.
- **Naming.** The project and Python package are renamed from `agentbroker`
  to **Passdesk** (package `passdesk/`), and the MCP server now reports
  itself as `"passdesk"` (`serverInfo.name`, see `passdesk/core/config.py`).
  Deployment identity is kept as-is on the consumer side: `ai-code-factory`
  still calls the sandbox `factory-broker` and uses the paths
  `/opt/factory-broker` and `/etc/factory-broker` — those are its deployment
  choices, not this project's identity.
- **License.** Apache-2.0, copyright holder "Daron Adkins" (**the user
  should confirm this is correct**).
